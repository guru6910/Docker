# Docker 

Docker is a platform that simplifies the process of building, deploying, and managing applications using containerization. It enables developers to package an application and its dependencies into a single, lightweight, and portable container that can run consistently across different environments.

# Container 

A Docker container is like a lightweight, portable mini-computer that you can use to run an application. Imagine you're working on your computer, but instead of installing and running a program directly on your operating system, you package everything the program needs into a self-contained box (the container). This box can then run anywhere, whether it's on your laptop, a server, or in the cloud.

# Docker Image 

Think of the Docker image as a recipe or blueprint for creating the container. Docker has an official Nginx image that contains everything needed to run Nginx: the Nginx software, its dependencies, and some basic configuration.
